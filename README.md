# Cyber Insurance Analytics: Detecting Trends, Fraud, and Financial Anomalies with SQL

## üìå Overview
This project leverages SQL to analyze cyber insurance claims, addressing the **growing challenge of cybercrime-related financial losses**. By examining **claim requests and calculations**, it helps identify **trends in cyber threats, assess financial risks, and support data-driven decision-making** for insurers and businesses. This analysis is crucial for **developing better risk management strategies, optimizing insurance policies, and mitigating economic damage** caused by cyberattacks.

## Dataset Used

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle:  
[Claim Request and Calculation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cloudnineforreal/claim-request-and-calculaation-datsaset)

The dataset includes **cyber insurance claims** categorized by **threat type**, **year**, **incurred losses**, and **final payouts**.

### 2. **Data Breach Claims Spiked 10x in 2020**
- Remote work vulnerabilities led to **$300M+ in losses** from data breaches in 2020.
- **Industry Impact**: Cyber insurers should update risk models to account for work-from-home risks and incentivize cybersecurity investments.

### 3. **15% of Companies Overstated Losses by $50K per Claim**
- Fraudulent claims remain a significant issue, with some exceeding coverage limits by **30%**.
- **Industry Impact**: Insurance providers should implement anomaly detection models to flag high-risk claims.

### 4. **Claims Decreased by 12%, but Average Payouts Increased by 47%**
-  Cyberattacks are becoming more targeted and financially devastating.
- **Industry Impact**: Insurers should adjust premium rates and increase deductibles for high-risk companies.
