# Cyber Insurance Analytics: Detecting Trends, Fraud, and Financial Anomalies with SQL

## üìå Overview
This project leverages SQL to analyze cyber insurance claims, addressing the **growing challenge of cybercrime-related financial losses**. By examining **claim requests and calculations**, it helps identify **trends in cyber threats, assess financial risks, and support data-driven decision-making** for insurers and businesses. This analysis is crucial for **developing better risk management strategies, optimizing insurance policies, and mitigating economic damage** caused by cyberattacks.

### üìä Dataset: [Claim Request and Calculation Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/)
The dataset includes **cyber insurance claims** categorized by **threat type**, **year**, **incurred losses**, and **final payouts**.

## üìú SQL Code Snippets  

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Companies with Most Claims**  
```sql
-- This query identifies the companies with the highest number of cyber insurance claims.  
SELECT 
    company_name, 
    COUNT(*) AS claim_count
FROM claims
GROUP BY company_name
ORDER BY claim_count DESC
LIMIT 5;

```
**2Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying Inflated Loss Claims**
```sql
--This query detects companies with inflated claim amounts by calculating discrepancies between incurred and verified losses.

WITH avg_losses AS (
    SELECT 
        company_name, 
        AVG(incurred_loss_amount - verified_incurred_loss_amount) AS avg_incurred_losses
    FROM claims
    GROUP BY company_name
)
SELECT 
    company_name, 
    ROUND(avg_incurred_losses, 2) AS inflated_losses
FROM avg_losses
WHERE avg_incurred_losses > (SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.90) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY avg_incurred_losses) FROM avg_losses)
ORDER BY inflated_losses DESC
LIMIT 10;

```
**3Ô∏è‚É£ Time-Series Analysis of Cyber Threats**
```sql
-- This query categorizes cyber insurance claims by threat type (Ransomware, Phishing, Data Breach, etc.) and tracks financial losses over time.

SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_of_incident) AS year, 
    CASE 
        WHEN description_of_incident ILIKE '%ransomware%' THEN 'Ransomware'
