# Cyber Insurance Analytics: Fraud Detection & Risk Assessment Using SQL

## üìå Overview
This project leverages SQL to analyze cyber insurance claims, addressing the **growing challenge of cybercrime-related financial losses**. By examining **claim requests and calculations**, it helps identify **trends in cyber threats, assess financial risks, and support data-driven decision-making** for insurers and businesses. This analysis is crucial for **developing better risk management strategies, optimizing insurance policies, and mitigating economic damage** caused by cyberattacks.

## Dataset Used  

This project uses the [Claim Request and Calculation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cloudnineforreal/claim-request-and-calculaation-datsaset) from Kaggle and it includes:  

- **Threat Types** (Ransomware, Phishing, Data Breach, etc.)  
- **Financial Impact** (Incurred Losses, Final Payouts)  
- **Policy Details** (Coverage Limits, Deductibles)  

The data was **cleaned and preprocessed** by handling missing values and standardizing date formats before running SQL queries.  

## üìå Key Questions Answered  

This project investigates cyber insurance claims using SQL to uncover fraud patterns, detect financial irregularities, and assess risk. Key questions addressed include:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Which companies fall within the top 5% of highest average payouts?**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Are some companies overstating their cyber losses to maximize claims?**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Are certain businesses underreporting losses to protect their reputation?**  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Which cyber threats show the biggest discrepancies between reported and verified losses?**  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Which companies repeatedly file claims for specific cyber threats over multiple years?**  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **How has the frequency of cyber insurance claims changed over time for different types of threats?**  
7Ô∏è‚É£ **Are fewer claims being filed, but with an increasing financial impact?**
